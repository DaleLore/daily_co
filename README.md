## Sample work: Raise your hand
This sample work includes sample code and a piece of content about implementing a `Raise your hand` feature during a video call in the form of a developer tutorial on Daily.co's blog: https://www.daily.co/blog/

### Set up your environment
You can create your own video chat interface using the Daily-js front-end library and three separate files: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS!

The Daily JavaScript library gives you several options for adding video calls to your web app. There's so many possibilities, but we'll focus on the "Raise your hand" feature. 

Let's go step by step over what you'll need and why.

#### Set up HTML
Create a basic HTML page
In the directory(folder) you're working in, create a new file `index.html`

Set up the basic HTML DOCTYPE structure (https://www.w3schools.com/html/)

And you can change the title in the head and add more information, but with that basic HTML structure, you have your html page set up!

Now continue to creating a Javascript file

#### Set up JavaScript
Create a basic JavaScript file
In the directory(folder) you're working in, create a new file `script.js`

And you're done! We'll be adding more here later because this is where all our code will go.

Now link up these two new files!


#### Connect them
From the <head> in your HTML, you'll need to connect your Javascript with a tag:
`<script type='text/javascript' src='./script.js'></script>`
