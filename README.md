This sample work includes sample code and a piece of content about implementing a `Raise your hand` feature during a video call in the form of a developer tutorial on Daily.co's blog: https://www.daily.co/blog/

### Set up your environment
You can create your own video chat interface using the Daily-js front-end library and three separate files: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS!

The Daily JavaScript library gives you several options for adding video calls to your web app. There's so many possibilities, but we'll focus on the "Raise your hand" feature.
