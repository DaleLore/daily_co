## Raise your hand
This sample work includes sample code and a piece of content about implementing a `Raise your hand` feature during a video call in the form of a developer tutorial on Daily.co's blog: https://www.daily.co/blog/


## Set up your environment

You can create your own video chat interface using the Daily-js front-end library and JavaScript, HTML, and CSS!

The Daily JavaScript library gives you several options for adding video calls to your web app. There's so many possibilities, but we'll focus on the "Raise your hand" feature. 

Let's go step by step over what you'll need and why. We're going to write everything in our HTML file, but you can separate the code based on JS or CSS.

### Set up HTML
- [ ] Basic HTML page

Set up the basic HTML DOCTYPE structure (https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
Create something like `index.html`, or name it anything you'll remember as long as you save it as `.html`
In a basic template, you can change the title in the `<head>` and add more information, but with that basic HTML structure. 

You have your basic html page set up! 


```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      
  </body>
</html>
```
<hr>

#### Optional: Set up JavaScript
- [ ] Basic JavaScript file

If you're separating your code based on HTML, JS, or CSS, then you'll also need to create something like `script.js`, or name it anything you'll remember as long as you save it as `.js`

<hr>

#### Optional: Set up CSS

- [ ] Basic CSS file

If you're separating your code based on HTML, JS, or CSS, then you'll also need to create something like `style.css`, or name it anything you'll remember as long as you save it as `.css`

<hr>

#### Optional: Connect them!
If you have three files, just because the files are in the directory (aka folder), doesn't mean they realize the others exist. So we'll connect them all in our HTML file.

In the <head> of your HTML file, you'll need to connect your Javascript and CSS with the following tags:

- [ ] Connect JS file
```
<script type='text/javascript' src='script.js'></script>
```

- [ ] Connect CSS file
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

# Before integrating Daily 
There are a couple of housekeeping steps:
1. Register at Daily.co
    This might seem redundant to mention, but this part is important because in order to customize and add features, you'll need what is called a `[Daily room URL]`(https://help.daily.co/en/articles/4202139-creating-and-viewing-rooms) because you'll be replacing the default code the Daily gives us with your own room URL.

    ```
    Look for this code: 
    https://your-team.daily.co/hello
    OR
    A_DAILY_CO_ROOM_URL
    ```

2.  Have the docs for Daily JS handy
    We're going to be referencing this documentation a lot: https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js

# How to set up Daily.co video calls
## Connect to Daily.co by loading the library in a script tag

The easiest way to get started is to load this library from unpkg, and add a couple of lines of code to your web page or app. We're goign to embed a Daily prebuilt into our files. You can refer to the docs where it mentions it: https://docs.daily.co/prebuilt#step-by-step-guide-embed-daily-prebuilt

You can just copy and paste this exact code into the `<head>` of your HTML file.

```
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/@daily-co/daily-js"></script>
``` 

<img src="./Assets/screenshot-dailyscript.png">

<hr>

## Create the Daily.co video call component 
There are a couple of ways we can add a frame (i.e. callObject, createframe(), etc), but we're going to embed the code Daily has so kindly shared for a prebuilt video call component. We've already referred to the docs here: https://docs.daily.co/prebuilt#step-by-step-guide-embed-daily-prebuilt

The Daily JS library script tag is already added in the `<head>`, so we're going to add the code snippet to the HTML's `<body>` and replacing the `https://your-team.daily.co/hello` in the code snippet with our own room URL.

```
<script>
      callFrame = window.DailyIframe.createFrame();
      callFrame.join({ url: 'https://your-team.daily.co/hello' });
</script>
```

<img src="./Assets/screenshot-dailyvideo.png">

At this point, you can start testing it out! Double click your `index.html` and it'll open up in your web browser and you'll be able to see your own personal video room. Don't worry about how it looks. You can change that with CSS if you want to.

##### Note: You might have noticed that you can't leave the call ðŸ˜¶ You'll need to add some configuration properties to `DailyIframe.createFrame()` to customize how the DailyIframe looks. For the leave call button, just add `showLeaveButton: true,` into the `DailyIframe.createFrame()`. For more information, check out: https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/daily-iframe-class/properties

```
callFrame = window.DailyIframe.createFrame({
  showLeaveButton: true,
});
```

# Daily.co API Events 
In the Daily.co docs, these are specific events we can listen for and react to with the JS functions (or callbacks): https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/events. We're going to code this raise hand feature by first creating the local participant and then other participants. 

## Local Participant
For a local participant, we want to know when they join, when they clicked on a button to raise their hand, and when they leave. We're going to use daily-js video call events for our local participant and create a customized JavaScript event listener for that raising hand feature.

### Daily.co API Events
* `on()`: This is an instance method that we'll add after joining the call and will evoke after callframe. This method will include an eventName as well as a callback. The eventName could be any of the Events listed in the daily-js docs: https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/events. The callbacks are the functions you'll create. 

* `joined-meeting`: This meeting event is when a local participant joins the call. It will return a list of all the participants: https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/events/meeting-events#joined-meeting 

* `left-meeting`: This meeting event is when a local participant leaves the call: https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/events/meeting-events#left-meeting

  ```
  <!-- eventNames -->
  callFrame.on("joined-meeting", joinedCall)
  callFrame.on("left-meeting", leftCall)

  <!-- callbacks -->
  function joinedCall(){

  }

  function leftCall(){
    
  }
  ```

### React when a user joins a call
Within the callback function of joinedCall, we're going to evoke another function where we'll create the participant. The `joined-meeting` event gives us important information like user_id and username. You can even check it out in your console with `e.participants.local`

This is also the point where I'll need to start create elements in the `<body>` so I can see what is happening. If I want to see all these new participants joining, I'm going to need to code space in the HTML to accommodate them. I'm going to create a `<div>` element to append all these new participants divs within my HTML. Just above the `<script>` tag.

```
<!-- In the body, above the script tags -->
<div id="participantsList">
            Participants
</div>
```

```
<!-- in the script tag, JavaScript part -->

async function joinedCall(e){
  createParticipantDiv(e.participants.local.user_id, e.participants.local.user_name)
}

function createParticipantDiv(id, username){
  let dailyUser = document.createElement('div')
   
   dailyUser = `
                   <div id=${id} class="participantBlock">
                    
                     <div class="participantBlock-item" id="usernameDiv"><h5>${username}</h5></div>
                 
                       <img 
                         id="${id}-hand"
                         src="./Assets/icon-raised-hand.png" 
                         class="participantBlock-item"
                         class="hand"
                         alt="Raised hand" 
                         style="display: none"
                         height="30px;"
                       />
                       <img 
                         id="local"
                         src="./Assets/icon-raised-hand.png" 
                         class="participantBlock-item"
                         class="hand"
                         alt="Raised hand" 
                         style="display: none"
                         height="30px;"
                       />
            
                   </div>
                 `
   addParticpipant.innerHTML += dailyUser
}
```
